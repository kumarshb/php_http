This is a simple HTTP server written in PHP.

1. Server.php - main class implementation of the server

2. webserver.php - script to handle incoming calls and replies

3. Put all the server configuration(hostname, port, etc) in config/config.php

4. htdocs is the standard directory to keep the public files
